**This is a mock repository.**

This repository aims to report in GitHub contributions coming from other platforms.

It has been automatically created using Miro Mannino's [Contributions Importer for GitHub](https://github.com/miromannino/contributions-importer-for-github)

## Notice

The content of this repository contains mock code. This prevents private source code from being leaked. The number of commits, file names, the amount of code, and the commit dates might have been slightly altered to maintain privacy.

Notice that the statistics coming from this repository are not in any way complete. Commits only come from other selected git repositories. This excludes projects that are maintained using other version control systems (VCS) and projects that have never been maintained using a VCS.

## Reasons

GitHub shows contributions statistics of its users. There are [several reasons](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/627) why this feature could be debatable.

Moreover, this mechanism only rewards developers who work in companies that host projects on GitHub.
Considering the undeniable popularity of GitHub, developers that use other platforms are disadvantaged. It is increasing the number of developers that refer to their [GitHub contributions in resumes](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com). Similarly, recruiters [may use GitHub to find talent](https://www.socialtalent.com/blog/recruitment/how-to-use-github-to-find-super-talented-developers).
